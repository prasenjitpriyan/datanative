# üìò **Introduction**

This material dives into the fundamentals of **REST APIs**, their constraints, and the concept of resources‚Äîkey components for seamless communication between clients and servers.

---

## üåê **Understanding REST APIs**

**REST** (Representational State Transfer) is an **architectural style** for designing APIs that simplifies the interaction between the front-end and back-end. It focuses on:

- **Ease of access** to back-end data.
- **Modification** of resources via defined HTTP methods.

To be considered a **RESTful API**, the following constraints must be met:

- **Client-Server Architecture**: Decouples the client (consumer) from the server (provider).
- **Statelessness**: The server doesn‚Äôt retain any information about previous requests.
- **Cacheability**: Responses can be cached to enhance performance.
- **Layered System**: Allows intermediaries like load balancers or proxies without impacting functionality.
- **Uniform Interface**: Provides consistency and simplifies communication between components.
- **Code on Demand (Optional)**: Servers can deliver executable code (e.g., JavaScript) to clients.

---

## üß± **Key Constraints of REST APIs**

1. **Client-Server Architecture**

   - Separates concerns, enabling independent development and scaling of clients and servers.

2. **Statelessness**

   - Each request from a client must contain all the necessary information since no session state is stored on the server.

3. **Cacheability**

   - Responses should explicitly indicate whether they are cacheable to enhance efficiency.

4. **Layered System**

   - A client cannot tell whether it is directly connected to the server or through an intermediary.

5. **Uniform Interface**
   - Simplifies and standardizes API interactions using consistent resource identifiers, HTTP methods, and formats.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è **Resources in REST APIs**

In REST, **resources** are the backbone of the API:

- **Definition**: Resources represent entities or data objects, such as users, products, or orders.
- **Representation**: They are accessed via **unique URLs**, such as `/users` or `/orders`.
- **Filtering**: APIs can apply parameters to filter or customize resource retrieval, ensuring flexibility while maintaining consistency.

For example:

- `/orders?status=pending` retrieves only orders with a pending status.
- `/products?category=electronics` filters products by category.

---

### üéØ **Why Master REST APIs?**

Understanding the principles of REST APIs empowers developers to:

- Build **scalable and efficient APIs**.
- Design **intuitive and maintainable endpoints**.
- Enable seamless integration between clients and servers.

---

# üìò **Introduction**

This material highlights the importance of **well-designed API endpoints**, focusing on **naming conventions** and **best practices** to enhance clarity and usability for developers.

---

## üñãÔ∏è **Naming Conventions for API Endpoints**

üîπ **Readable Names**

- Use **lowercase letters** and **hyphens** (`-`) to separate words for better readability.
  - **Example**: `/menu-items`
- Avoid using **underscores**, **camelCase**, or **TitleCase**, except in variable representations.

üîπ **Resource-Based Naming**

- Always use **nouns** to represent resources, such as `orders` or `menu-items`.
  - **Do This**: `/users` or `/orders`
  - **Avoid**: `/getOrders` or `/orders.php`

---

## üå≤ **Hierarchical Relationships and Query Parameters**

üîπ **Hierarchical Relationships**

- Use **forward slashes** (`/`) to represent hierarchy in your API endpoints.
  - **Example**: `/customers/orders` to indicate that customers can have multiple orders.

üîπ **Query Parameters for Filtering**

- Use **query strings** to filter results or specify data formats.
  - **Example**:
    - `/menu-items?category=appetizer` to filter by category.
    - `/data?format=json` to specify the data format.

---

## ‚úÖ **Reinforcing Best Practices**

- üö´ **Avoid Trailing Slashes**: Exclude trailing slashes (`/`) from the end of your API endpoints for consistency.

  - **Good**: `/api/users`
  - **Not Recommended**: `/api/users/`

- üõ†Ô∏è **Consistency Matters**: Adhering to these conventions ensures your APIs are:
  - **Easy to understand**.
  - **Developer-friendly**.
  - **Scalable** for future changes.

---

### üéØ **Why Follow Best Practices?**

Following these practices makes your APIs:

- Easier to use by other developers.
- Aligned with industry standards.
- More maintainable and extendable.

### **Example Calls**

| **HTTP Method** | **Sample Endpoints** | **Payload/Query**                                                                                                       |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GET**         | `/api/menu-items`    | Filter with query params: `/api/menu-items?category=appetizers&perPage=3&page=2`. No payload required for GET requests. |
| **POST**        | `/api/menu-items`    | Example JSON payload: <br> `{ "title": "Beef Steak", "price": 5.50, "category": "main" }`                               |
| **PUT**         | `/api/menu-items/1`  | Replaces the resource completely: <br> `{ "title": "Chicken Steak", "price": 2.50, "category": "main" }`                |
| **PATCH**       | `/api/menu-items/1`  | Partially updates the resource: <br> `{ "price": 3.00 }`                                                                |
| **DELETE**      | `/api/menu-items/1`  | Deletes the resource at `/api/menu-items/1`.                                                                            |

---

## **HTTP Status Codes**

Proper status codes ensure clear communication between the client and the server. Each code has a specific purpose:

| **Range**   | **Purpose**                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **100-199** | Informational. For example, `102 Processing` indicates the server is handling the request but isn‚Äôt ready yet.                                                           |
| **200-299** | Success. For instance, `200 OK` for GET/DELETE, `201 Created` for POST, and `204 No Content` when there‚Äôs no response body.                                              |
| **300-399** | Redirection. E.g., `301 Moved Permanently` redirects clients to a new endpoint.                                                                                          |
| **400-499** | Client Errors. Examples: <br> - `400 Bad Request` for invalid payloads, <br> - `404 Not Found` for missing resources, <br> - `401 Unauthorized`, <br> - `403 Forbidden`. |
| **500-599** | Server Errors. Generated when something fails on the server-side, like uncaught exceptions or database connection issues.                                                |

---

## **Response Types**

REST APIs often respond in formats like **JSON**, **XML**, or **plain text**. Frameworks often include built-in tools for formatting responses based on the client‚Äôs `Accept` header.

| **Response Type** | **Request Header**                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **HTML**          | `Accept: text/html`                               |
| **JSON**          | `Accept: application/json`                        |
| **XML**           | `Accept: application/xml` or `Accept: text/xml`   |
| **YAML**          | `Accept: application/yaml` or `Accept: text/yaml` |

---

### **Conclusion**

Understanding and applying HTTP methods, status codes, and response types correctly ensures that your APIs are consistent, user-friendly, and aligned with RESTful standards. Following these conventions makes debugging easier and fosters better collaboration with other developers.

# **REST API Best Practices**

Creating a REST API is simple, but building a robust, reliable, and high-performing API requires careful planning and adherence to best practices. Below are the essential guidelines every API developer should follow:

---

### **1. Keep It Simple (KISS)**

A REST API should be designed to handle a single, specific task efficiently. Avoid combining multiple operations into one API.  
**Example:**  
For a menu management system:

- To update the status of an item (e.g., "item of the day"), send an HTTP PATCH/PUT request:
  - **Endpoint:** `/menu-items/16`
  - **Body:** `{ "status": "Off" }`
- For the new "item of the day," use another PATCH/PUT request:
  - **Endpoint:** `/menu-items/21`
  - **Body:** `{ "status": "On" }`

---

### **2. Filtering, Ordering, and Pagination**

APIs should allow clients to filter and sort results while supporting pagination to handle large datasets.  
**Example:**

- **Filters:**
  - Query string parameters like `/menu-items?category=desserts` to fetch specific categories.
- **Pagination:**
  - `/menu-items?page=10&size=4` to fetch 4 items from page 10.
- **Sorting:**
  - `/menu-items?sort=price&order=asc` for ascending price order.

---

### **3. Versioning**

Introduce versioning to avoid breaking client applications when making significant updates.  
**Best Practices:**

- Use versioning in the URL (e.g., `/v1/menu-items`).
- Maintain only the last two versions of an API to reduce complexity.

---

### **4. Caching**

Caching improves performance by reducing database load and network latency.  
**Example:**

- Cache results for endpoints like `/menu-items`.
- Serve cached responses for unchanged data, refreshing only when modifications occur.
- Use HTTP cache headers (`Cache-Control`) for efficient cache management.

---

### **5. Rate Limiting and Monitoring**

To prevent abuse and ensure stability:

- **Rate Limiting:** Restrict the number of requests per time frame (e.g., per minute or per day).
- **Monitoring:**
  - Track status codes (e.g., `400-499` for client errors, `500-599` for server errors).
  - Monitor network bandwidth to detect API misuse.
  - Ensure low latency to optimize response times.

---

By adhering to these best practices‚Äî**KISS, filtering, pagination, versioning, caching, rate limiting, and monitoring**‚Äîyou can build high-quality, sustainable, and scalable REST APIs. These principles will help you deliver a smooth and efficient user experience while maintaining the reliability and performance of your APIs.

### Protecting APIs: Best Practices and Security

APIs are essential for making your data accessible, not just for your apps and websites but also for third-party clients, increasing its usefulness. However, their public availability can pose risks to your back-end services. This guide covers **best practices** to secure your APIs and protect your infrastructure.

---

### 1. **SSL: Secure Socket Layer**

- **Purpose**: Encrypts data between the browser and web server.
- **Implementation**:
  - Install SSL certificates from a trusted provider.
  - Serve APIs over **HTTPS** instead of HTTP.
- **Tip**: Always verify that API endpoints start with `https://`.

---

### 2. **Signed URLs**

- **Objective**: Restrict API access to trusted clients.
- **How it Works**:
  - Attach a **signature** to each URL.
  - Server-side code verifies the signature to ensure authenticity.
- **Mechanism**: Use **HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)**.
  - Combines a secret message and key using a digest algorithm to create the signature.

---

### 3. **Authentication**

- **Token-Based Authentication** (preferred over HTTP Basic Authentication):
  - User logs in with credentials once and receives a **unique token**.
  - Include the token as an HTTP header in subsequent API calls.
- **Tools**:
  - Use **JSON Web Token (JWT)** for a standardized approach.
- **HTTP Status Codes**:
  - `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid username or password.
  - `403 Forbidden`: Valid credentials, but insufficient permissions.

---

### 4. **CORS Policy and Firewalls**

- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**:
  - Control which domains can access your API.
  - Configure CORS headers to restrict unauthorized access.
- **Firewalls**:
  - Allow access only from specific IP addresses to tighten security.

---

### **Conclusion**

Securing APIs is crucial for protecting your infrastructure and user data. By implementing these strategies‚ÄîSSL, signed URLs, token-based authentication, CORS policies, and firewalls‚Äîyou can ensure that your APIs are robust and secure. Start applying these practices today to safeguard your backend services.

# Access Control in APIs: Secure Your Data Effectively üöÄ

The **Little Lemon API** provides endpoints to view order details, including sensitive customer data such as delivery addresses. Ensuring only authorized users‚Äîlike managers and delivery crew‚Äîcan access these APIs is critical. This guide focuses on **access control**, a cornerstone of API security, to protect sensitive information and maintain proper data governance.

---

## 1. **What is Access Control?**

Access control defines **who** can access your APIs and **what data** they can interact with. It ensures:

- Only the right users manage sensitive data.
- Unauthorized users are denied access.

**Key Concepts**:

- **Roles**: A collection of privileges assigned to a user.
- **Privileges**: Specific actions a user can perform.

---

## 2. **Roles and Privileges: Examples**

### **Customer Role**

Privileges include:

- Browsing menu items.
- Adding items to the cart.
- Placing orders.
- Adding food reviews.
- Viewing personal order history.

### **Manager Role**

Privileges include:

- Adding, editing, and deleting menu items.
- Viewing all orders and customer data.
- Assigning orders to the delivery crew.
- Viewing transaction data.

### **Delivery Crew Role**

Privileges include:

- Viewing assigned orders.
- Updating the status of assigned orders.

Other potential roles:

- **Administrator**: Full system control.
- **HR Representative**: Access to HR-related data.
- **Accountant**: Access to financial records.

---

## 3. **Authorization vs. Authentication**

- **Authentication**: Confirms the user's identity (e.g., login).
- **Authorization**: Determines what the user can do after authentication (e.g., access control).

---

## 4. **Strategies for Role Management**

### **Single Role with Comprehensive Privileges**

Assign all necessary privileges to one role for a user.

- **Example**: A manager role includes privileges from accountant and HR roles.

### **Task-Specific Roles**

Assign multiple specific roles to a user.

- **Example**: The general manager has:
  - Accountant role (financial access).
  - HR role (HR data access).
  - Manager role (operational access).

**Benefits**:

- Easy to update individual role privileges.
- Automatically updates user capabilities when roles are modified.

---

## 5. **Designing Effective Access Control**

- **Detail-Oriented Privileges**: The more granular, the better.
- **Scalable Role System**: Simplifies updates and additions.
- **Future-Proof Design**: Saves time and effort in debugging and refactoring.

---

## **Conclusion**

A well-designed API access control system is an investment in security and efficiency. By clearly defining roles and privileges, you can:

- Ensure sensitive data is accessible only to the right users.
- Avoid costly issues during development and beyond.

Take the time to plan your access control system thoughtfully‚Äîyour project will thank you in the long run! üí°

# Authentication vs. Authorization: Understanding the Difference üöÄ

APIs provide access to backend data for third-party clients, making security a top priority. If left unsecured, APIs can expose sensitive information or allow tampering with data. This guide explores the crucial concepts of **authentication** and **authorization** to protect API endpoints effectively.

---

## **Introduction**

- **Authentication**: Confirms **who** you are.
- **Authorization**: Determines **what** you can do.

These processes, while interconnected, serve distinct purposes. Let‚Äôs dive deeper into their roles in API security.

---

## **1. Authentication: Verifying User Identity**

Authentication is the process of confirming the user's credentials (e.g., username and password). Successful authentication allows the user to access the system.

### **How It Works:**

1. **Login**: User submits credentials.
2. **Token Issuance**: If valid, the server provides a **bearer token**.
3. **Token Validation**: Client includes the token in every API call. Server validates it before granting access.

### **HTTP Status Codes**:

- `200 OK`: Credentials verified successfully.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid credentials.

### **Analogy**:

Think of this as your first day at work:

- You provide all necessary documents.
- You receive an employee ID card.
- Your ID card is used for subsequent access.

### **Diagrams**:

1. **Authentication Process**: Shows how tokens are issued.
2. **Authenticated API Calls**: Demonstrates token usage for secure API access.

---

## **2. Authorization: Controlling User Actions**

Authorization determines whether a user has the necessary privileges to perform specific actions. It is an additional layer of security after authentication.

### **How It Works:**

1. **User Roles**: Users are assigned roles or groups.
2. **Privilege Check**: After verifying the token, the server checks if the user‚Äôs role permits the requested action.

### **HTTP Status Codes**:

- `200 OK`: Authorized action.
- `403 Forbidden`: Insufficient privileges.

### **Analogy**:

Even with an employee ID, access to certain areas (e.g., server room) may require special permissions. Authorization ensures you can only perform tasks relevant to your role.

### **Diagrams**:

1. **API Authorization**: Illustrates how roles and privileges are verified.

---

## **3. Implementing Authorization**

An effective authorization system prevents data corruption and breaches.

### **Steps**:

1. **Define Privileges**: Identify tasks users can perform.
   - Example: In a bookstore API:
     - **Browse books**: All users.
     - **Add/Edit/Delete books**: Managers only.
     - **Place orders**: Authenticated customers.
2. **Create Roles**: Group related privileges into roles.
   - Example:
     - **Customer Role**: Browse and place orders.
     - **Manager Role**: Add, edit, delete books.
3. **Backend Checks**: Verify user roles at each API endpoint.
   - Allow or deny actions based on role privileges.

---

## **4. Key Takeaways**

- **Authentication**: "Who are you?"
  - Verifies identity.
  - Grants access to the system.
- **Authorization**: "What can you do?"
  - Validates privileges.
  - Controls access to specific actions or data.

Together, these processes form the backbone of API security, ensuring safe and controlled data access.

---

## **Conclusion**

Understanding **authentication** and **authorization** is essential for securing your APIs. By implementing these concepts effectively, you can build robust security layers that protect sensitive information and maintain system integrity. Use this foundation to enhance your API projects with user groups, roles, and privileges.

**Secure your APIs‚ÄîSecure your data.** üîê

## Overview

Up to this point, you've learned quite a lot about **REST APIs** along with best practices for using them. Now, Adrian wants you to start using REST APIs within the **Little Lemon Mobile App**. In order to do this, you'll first need to learn how to interact with REST APIs in **React Native** to make calls to the server. This guide will walk you through how to do just that.

### Key Learning Objectives

- **Network Calls with the Fetch API** in React Native
- **Handling HTTP Requests and Responses**
- **Working with Promises and Asynchronous Operations**

---

## Making Network Calls Using the Fetch API

In this section, you'll become familiar with making network calls using the **Fetch API** in React Native. The Fetch API is a built-in method for making network requests and handling responses, making it easier to interact with APIs.

### What is the Fetch API?

The Fetch API allows you to make requests to a server, retrieve data, or make **POST requests**. It's similar to **XMLHttpRequest** or other networking APIs you may have used before.

#### **Why use Fetch API?**

- It is **asynchronous**, meaning that the application doesn't wait for the server to respond before continuing with other operations.
- **Promises** are used to handle the eventual completion or failure of the request.

---

## Promises in JavaScript

A **Promise** represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. This makes it easier to handle network operations without blocking the app's execution.

- **Asynchronous operations** help optimize applications so they do not wait for a server's response before performing other tasks.

---

## Making GET and POST Requests

### **GET Request**

To retrieve data, you will use the `fetch()` method and pass the URL you need to fetch content from.

For example, to fetch a menu from the Little Lemon restaurant:

```js
fetch('https://example.com/get-little-lemon-menu')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.log(error))
```

### **POST Request**

For a **POST request**, you can customize the request by passing an optional second argument with the **method** and **headers**. For example:

```js
fetch('https://example.com/submit-order', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    item: 'Pizza',
    quantity: 2
  })
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.log(error))
```

---

## Handling Responses

After making a request, you need to handle the response. Since network calls are asynchronous, you can use **async/await** for a cleaner syntax:

```js
const getMenuItems = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://example.com/get-little-lemon-menu')
    const menuItems = await response.json()
    return menuItems
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('Error:', error)
  }
}
```

### **Error Handling**

If the server times out or any other error occurs, you need to catch it:

```js
fetch('https://example.com/get-little-lemon-menu')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error('Error fetching data:', error))
```

---

## Explore Other Networking Libraries

While the Fetch API is sufficient for most cases, you may also explore other networking libraries, such as **XMLHttpRequest**, which is also built into React Native.

---

## Conclusion

In this video, you've learned how to make network calls using the Fetch API in React Native. You've explored how HTTP requests are made, how to handle responses, and how to use **async/await** syntax to manage asynchronous code. You also learned how to handle errors and catch them effectively.

Next, you'll discover how to fetch data and handle responses from within the **Little Lemon** app!

---

## **HTTP Protocol and Promises in Detail**

Previously, you discovered how to make **HTTP calls** from your React Native app while using the **async/await** methods to resolve promises. You've become familiar with the built-in `fetch` method in React Native and learned how to fetch data and handle the response from an API.

In this section, we will dive deeper into **HTTP calls**, including additional features and best practices for interacting with APIs in React Native. Let's refresh some of the key concepts before we continue.

---

## **Making a GET Request**

To fetch content from a URL, you can use the `fetch` method in React Native, which is a built-in API for making network requests. Here's an example of how to use it:

```js
fetch(
  'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Meta-Mobile-Developer-PC/Working-With-Data-API/main/littleLemonSimpleMenu.json'
)
```

---

## **Handling the Response**

The goal of making an HTTP request is to perform an action with the response data. The `fetch` method returns a **Promise** that resolves once the response is received from the server. To handle the Promise, you can use the **async/await** syntax, which makes your code more readable and easier to maintain.

Here's an example where we fetch the Little Lemon menu data and handle the response:

```js
const getMenu = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(
      'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Meta-Mobile-Developer-PC/Working-With-Data-API/main/littleLemonSimpleMenu.json'
    )
    const json = await response.json()
    setData(json.menu)
    console.log(json.menu)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
  } finally {
    // Perform any final actions
  }
}
```

- **`catch` block**: Catches any errors that occur during the fetch process.
- **`finally` block**: Executes any remaining code, regardless of whether the fetch request succeeds or fails.

For the complete code for fetching the menu data using a GET request, you can download the zipped folder below.

---

## **POST Requests**

While **GET requests** are used to retrieve data, **POST requests** are used to send data to a server. In React Native, the `fetch` method can also be used to make **POST requests** to send data, such as user credentials, to the server.

### **POST Request Example ‚Äì Login a User**

When a user logs into the Little Lemon app, you need to send their credentials (e.g., name, email, password) to the server. Here's an example of how to make a POST request to send the login credentials:

```js
const loginUser = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://your-website.com/login', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Accept: 'application/json',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        email: 'user@example.com',
        password: 'password123'
      })
    })
    const jsonResponse = await response.json()
    console.log(jsonResponse)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
  }
}
```

In the above code:

- **`method: 'POST'`** specifies that this is a POST request.
- **`body`** contains the request data, which is sent as a JSON string.
- **`headers`** specify the request's content type, indicating that the data being sent is in JSON format.

Once the request is made, the server will process the credentials, and the app will handle the response accordingly.

---

## **Other Networking Libraries**

While the `fetch` method is a simple and commonly used way to make network requests in React Native, there are other networking libraries you can explore:

- **`XMLHttpRequest`**: Built into React Native, this is an alternative to `fetch` that you can use to make network requests.
- **Third-party libraries** like **Axios** build on top of `XMLHttpRequest` and provide additional features.

### **XMLHttpRequest Example**

Here‚Äôs an example of how to use `XMLHttpRequest` directly:

```js
var request = new XMLHttpRequest()
request.onreadystatechange = (e) => {
  if (request.readyState !== 4) {
    return
  }

  if (request.status === 200) {
    console.log('Success:', request.responseText)
  } else {
    console.warn('Error:', request.status)
  }
}
request.open('GET', 'https://example.com/data', true)
request.send()
```

While `XMLHttpRequest` is more verbose than `fetch`, it‚Äôs still useful in certain situations, and third-party libraries like Axios can provide even more functionality.

---

## **Conclusion**

React Native offers various networking libraries, and you should choose the one that best suits your needs. In this reading, you've learned how to:

- Make **GET** and **POST** requests using the `fetch` method.
- Handle responses and errors effectively.
- Use **async/await** syntax to manage asynchronous operations.
- Explore other networking libraries like **XMLHttpRequest** and **Axios**.

With these tools, you‚Äôre well-equipped to interact with APIs and handle networking within your React Native apps.

  }';

  const result = JSON.parse(myStr);
  console.log(result.name);  // Output: Veggie Kabob
};
```

### üìÇ Accessing JSON Properties:

```javascript
result.name // Output: Veggie Kabob
result.price // Output: $12
result.type // Output: Main Dish
```

## üíª Full Component Example

Here‚Äôs how to integrate the conversion into a React Native component:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Text, View, StyleSheet, SafeAreaView } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  const [myJSON, setJsonObj] = useState({});

  const convertStringToJson = () => {
    const myStr = '{
      "name": "Veggie Kabob",
      "price": "$12",
      "type": "Main Dish"
    }';

    const result = JSON.parse(myStr);
    setJsonObj(result);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    convertStringToJson();
  }, []);

  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.itemText}>{'Menu Item: ' + myJSON.name}</Text>
      <Text style={styles.itemText}>{'Price: ' + myJSON.price}</Text>
      <Text style={styles.itemText}>{'Type: ' + myJSON.type}</Text>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  itemText: {
    fontSize: 18,
    margin: 10,
  },
});
```

### üñ• Output:

- **Menu Item:** Veggie Kabob
- **Price:** $12
- **Type:** Main Dish

## üîÑ Converting an Array of Strings to JSON

What if we need to handle multiple menu items? Let‚Äôs convert a **stringified array** into a JSON object.

**üç¥ Raw String Array:**

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Veggie Kabob",
    "price": "$12",
    "type": "Main Dish"
  },
  {
    "name": "Greek Salad",
    "price": "$7",
    "type": "Side"
  }
]
```

### üîß Using `JSON.parse()`

Here‚Äôs how you parse and display multiple items:

**üõ† Code Example:**

```javascript
const convertStringToJson = () => {
  const myStr = '[
    {
      "name": "Veggie Kabob",
      "price": "$12",
      "type": "Main Dish"
    },
    {
      "name": "Greek Salad",
      "price": "$7",
      "type": "Side"
    }
  ]';

  const result = JSON.parse(myStr);
  console.log(result);
};
```

### üóÇ Displaying Items Using `.map()`

**üíª Full Component Example:**

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Text, View, StyleSheet, SafeAreaView } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  const [menuItems, setMenuItems] = useState([]);

  const convertStringToJson = () => {
    const myStr = '[
      {
        "name": "Veggie Kabob",
        "price": "$12",
        "type": "Main Dish"
      },
      {
        "name": "Greek Salad",
        "price": "$7",
        "type": "Side"
      }
    ]';

    const result = JSON.parse(myStr);
    setMenuItems(result);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    convertStringToJson();
  }, []);

  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
      {menuItems.map((item, index) => (
        <View key={index} style={styles.itemContainer}>
          <Text style={styles.itemText}>{'Menu Item: ' + item.name}</Text>
          <Text style={styles.itemText}>{'Price: ' + item.price}</Text>
          <Text style={styles.itemText}>{'Type: ' + item.type}</Text>
        </View>
      ))}
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  itemContainer: {
    margin: 10,
  },
  itemText: {
    fontSize: 18,
  },
});
```

### üñ• Output:

- **Menu Item:** Veggie Kabob, **Price:** $12, **Type:** Main Dish
- **Menu Item:** Greek Salad, **Price:** $7, **Type:** Side

## üèÅ Conclusion

- üîë **Key Takeaways**:
  - Use `JSON.parse()` to convert strings into JSON objects or arrays.
  - Access properties directly using dot notation (e.g., `result.name`).
  - Use `.map()` to display multiple items dynamically.

By mastering these techniques, you can handle JSON data effectively in your React Native projects. üöÄ
